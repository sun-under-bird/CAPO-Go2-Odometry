# CAPO-LeggedRobotOdometry 🦾  [![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-See%20LICENSE-blue.svg)](LICENSE)

Chinese version readme.md is in contributting.md.

**CAPO-LeggedRobotOdometry** is a **pure proprioceptive odometry library** for legged robots, implemented with a **portable C++ estimator core** that depends only on **IMU and joint motor data**.

The core estimation logic is implemented in **`FusionEstimator/fusion_estimator.h`**. The file **`fusion_estimator_node.cpp`** provides a **ROS 2 wrapper** around this estimator, while the **`Matlab/`** folder contains examples for **MATLAB + C++ mixed compilation** and offline evaluation.

For side-by-side comparison, **`Matlab/Comparison/invariant-ekf/`** provides a MATLAB mixed-compilation workflow for **`invariant-ekf`**, making it easier to compare this repository against a representative open-source legged odometry baseline.

In 3D closed-loop trials (a **200 m** horizontal and **15 m** vertical loop), Astrall point-foot robot A achieves **0.1638 m** horizontal error and **0.219 m** vertical error; for wheel-legged robot B, the corresponding errors are **0.2264 m** and **0.199 m**.

## 📦 Data Sharing (Go2-EDU ROS bags)

To help readers quickly validate the pipeline, we provide **Go2-EDU trial datasets**, including **real-world videos**, derived CSV files, and the corresponding **ROS bag topics/messages** required by this node, enabling fast reproduction and sanity checks.

* Download (GitHub Releases): https://github.com/ShineMinxing/CAPO-LeggedRobotOdometry/releases/tag/DataForTest
* Recommended assets in that release include `GO2Flat`, `GO2Stairs`, `MPXY150Z10`, `MWXY150Z10`, `robot_flat_1_compress.zip`, and `robot_stairs_1_compress.zip`

> Note: the IMU on this Go2-EDU platform exhibits **noticeable yaw drift**, so the odometry accuracy is generally **worse than** the results reported for Astrall robots A and B in the paper.

## ✨ Key Features

| Category | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Biped / Quadruped / Wheel-Legged Unified** | Online contact-set switching; stance legs are detected automatically, supporting fast transitions between standing and walking. |
| **IMU + Joint-Motor Only** | The estimator core works with only IMU and joint motor measurements, without requiring cameras or LiDAR. |
| **MATLAB / C++ Mixed Compilation** | The `Matlab/` folder provides MATLAB + MEX examples for calling the same C++ core, and `Matlab/Comparison/invariant-ekf/` includes a comparable mixed-compilation setup for `invariant-ekf`. |
| **Full 3D & Planar 2D** | Publishes both 6DoF odometry (`SMX/Odom`) and a gravity-flattened 2D odometry (`SMX/Odom_2D`). |
| **Portable Pure C++ Core** | The estimator core is isolated in `FusionEstimator/`, making it easier to reuse outside ROS2. |
| **Runtime Tuning** | Key parameters can be adjusted through `config.yaml`, and platform-dependent thresholds can be tuned for different robots. |

## 🧩 Architecture Notes

This repository is intentionally split into three layers:

### 1. Estimator core
The actual odometry algorithm is implemented in **`FusionEstimator/fusion_estimator.h`** and the accompanying files under **`FusionEstimator/`**.  
This is the **main pure C++ proprioceptive estimator core**, designed to work with only **IMU and joint motor data**.

### 2. ROS2 wrapper
**`fusion_estimator_node.cpp`** wraps the estimator core into a ROS 2 node, handling:

* ROS2 topic subscriptions
* parameter loading
* message conversion
* odometry publication

### 3. MATLAB mixed-compilation support
The **`Matlab/`** folder provides examples for compiling and calling the same C++ estimator core from MATLAB via MEX.  
In addition, **`Matlab/Comparison/invariant-ekf/`** provides a comparable MATLAB mixed-compilation workflow for **`invariant-ekf`**, which is useful for offline benchmarking and side-by-side evaluation.

## ⚙️ Configuration (`config.yaml`)

The table below lists the main parameters used by the ROS2 node. See `config.yaml` for the full file and comments.

| `leg_pos_enable` | `true` | enable leg-position kinematics |
| `leg_vel_enable` | `true` | enable leg-velocity kinematics |

> Notes:
> * The exact values are platform-dependent.
> * Some fields in `config.yaml` may be experimental, legacy, or intended for specific branches / workflows.
> * If you port only the pure C++ core, you usually need to keep only the estimator-relevant fields and can drop ROS2-specific naming.

## ⚙️ Build & Run

### Clone the repository

```bash
mkdir -p ~/ros2_ws/src
cd ~/ros2_ws/src
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/ShineMinxing/CAPO-LeggedRobotOdometry.git
cd ~/ros2_ws
colcon build --packages-select fusion_estimator
source install/setup.bash
ros2 run fusion_estimator fusion_estimator_node
```

### Run directly on this Go2 (`/lowstate` adapter)

This checkout is configured for `/root/CAPO-LeggedRobotOdometry` on a Unitree Go2
running Ubuntu 22.04 and ROS 2 Humble. The adapter converts the existing
`unitree_go/msg/LowState` topic into the two CAPO input topics and throttles the
robot's roughly 500 Hz low-state stream to the estimator's 200 Hz model interval.

```bash
source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash
source /root/unitree_ros2/cyclonedds_ws/install/setup.bash
source <your_colcon_workspace>/install/setup.bash
ros2 launch fusion_estimator go2_capo.launch.py
```

The adapter reorders Unitree's `FR, FL, RR, RL` motor/foot sequence to CAPO's
`FL, FR, RL, RR` sequence, inserts zero-valued wheel slots, and publishes the
contact sensor values in `data[34, 38, 42, 46]`.

To launch CAPO together with this Go2 driver's
`/root/stereo/src/go2_driver/launch/driver.launch.py`:

```bash
source /root/stereo/install/setup.bash
source <your_colcon_workspace>/install/setup.bash
ros2 launch fusion_estimator go2_capo_with_driver.launch.py
```

The CAPO 2D odometry uses `odom` as `header.frame_id` and `base_footprint` as
`child_frame_id`, and CAPO publishes the matching `odom -> base_footprint` TF.
The driver owns `base_footprint -> base_link`, so the two nodes form a complete
TF chain without publishing the same transform.

## 🧠 Algorithm Overview (High Level)

1. **Contact detection**  
   Detect stance legs from force / threshold logic.

2. **Forward kinematics**  
   Compute foot-end position / velocity in the body frame from joint measurements.

3. **Contact anchoring**  
   Record touchdown footfall points and use them as intermittent world-frame constraints during stance.

4. **Height stabilization**  
   Use support-plane height logic and confidence decay to reduce long-horizon elevation drift.

5. **Optional IKVel-CKF (CAPO-CKE)**  
   Suppress encoder-induced velocity spikes and obtain smoother leg-end velocity estimates.

6. **Optional yaw stabilization**  
   Use multi-contact geometric consistency to reduce IMU yaw drift during prolonged standing.

7. **2D projection**  
   Publish a planar odometry (`SMX/Odom_2D`) by flattening roll / pitch while preserving yaw and planar motion.

## 🔧 Reusing `FusionEstimator/` Outside ROS2

If you do **not** need ROS2, the reusable part is mainly under `FusionEstimator/`.

A typical migration path is:

1. keep the estimator core in `FusionEstimator/`
2. replace ROS2 message subscriptions with your own sensor interface
3. prepare IMU, joint position / velocity, and contact / force inputs
4. call the estimator core from your own loop
5. export odometry to your target middleware / runtime

This design is useful for:

* ROS1 migration
* embedded deployment
* offline replay tools
* MATLAB / simulation analysis
* custom robotics middleware

---

## 🧪 MATLAB / MEX (Optional)

The **`Matlab/`** folder provides examples for compiling the estimator core into a MATLAB-callable MEX module.

Typical workflow:

```matlab
cd Matlab
build_mex
fusion_estimator
```

Files in this folder:

* `build_mex.m` — build script for MEX compilation
* `fusion_estimator_mex.cpp` — MEX bridge wrapping the C++ estimator core
* `fusion_estimator.m` — MATLAB-side usage / validation example
* sample CSV files and compressed test datasets — published via GitHub Releases: https://github.com/ShineMinxing/CAPO-LeggedRobotOdometry/releases/tag/DataForTest

For comparison with another representative legged-odometry implementation, Matlab/Comparison/invariant-ekf/ also provides a MATLAB mixed-compilation workflow for invariant-ekf.

---

## 📈 Visualization

A `Plotjuggler.xml` file is included in the repository for convenient visualization and debugging with PlotJuggler.

You can use it to inspect:

* odometry outputs
* IMU-related signals
* joint / force-related channels
* estimator behavior during walking, standing, or reset events
